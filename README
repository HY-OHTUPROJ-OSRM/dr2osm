https://ava.vaylapilvi.fi/ava/Tie/Digiroad/Aineistojulkaisut

Dependencies
------------

- libsqlite3
- libproj

Installation
------------

Navigate to the project root directory and run the command

	./build.sh release

to compile the program. This outputs a single executable file called `dr2osm`.

Usage
-----

The program takes two arguments: first the name of the geopackage file used as
input and second the name of the OSM file to be written. For example:

	dr2osm KokoSuomi_Digiroad_K_GeoPackage.gpkg route-data.osm

The following commandline can be used to modify the behavior of the program.
If present, they must precede the input argument.

	--mml-iceroads <ice-road-path>	Includes ice roads from MML ice road
					data in the output.
	--default-speed-limits		For ways without a specified speed
					limit in the source data, enters a
					default speed limit based on the type
					of way in question.
