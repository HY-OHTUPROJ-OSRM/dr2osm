dr2osm
======

Command line utility to convert Digiroad K-material geopackage to an OSM format
compatible with OSRM. Get the Digiroad material at
https://ava.vaylapilvi.fi/ava/Tie/Digiroad/Aineistojulkaisut

Dependencies
------------

- libsqlite3
- libproj

Installation
------------

Navigate to the project root directory and run the command

	./build.sh release

to compile the program. This outputs a single executable file called `dr2osm`.

Usage
-----

The program takes two arguments: first the name of the geopackage file used as
input and second the name of the OSM file to be written. For example:

	dr2osm KokoSuomi_Digiroad_K_GeoPackage.gpkg route-data.osm

If the input argument is preceded by the flag --mml-iceroads followed by the
name of a geopackage file containing National land survey (Maanmittauslaitos)
ice road data, those roads will be included in the output OSM file with the
"ice_road" tag.
